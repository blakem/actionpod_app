Over the last few years I've tried several different structures to light a fire under my ass.  When I look back
on the times that I've been the most productive is that I've had some structure in place to keep me pointed in the
right direction.  And most of the time that's been with someone else.  I seem to get more motivated when I have
someone watching me and cheering me on.

However, those structures tended to fade away over time.  One or both of us would start slipping.  The other one wouldn't
call it out.  Something would just happen over time and the container would lose momentum.  Pretty soon the container would
just slip away all together.  I had to work hard at maintaining my side of the bargain and eventually it would just
fade away.

And if you've ever tried to set up an accountability group, that's tough too.  You've got to find a group of people who are
dedicated enough to go for it that can all agree on a time that works for all of them.  It's a challenge.  And most of 
the time it doesn't work.

I was in that position a couple months ago, an accountabiltiy team that was slowly drifting apart.  And I thought about
what I could do to bring more people into it.  Over the course of a few weeks I came up with an idea.  Solve it all at once
for everyone.  Just put people into timeslots and then dish out the conference rooms as they come.  You aren't 
guaranteed to have the same people all the time, but with a little bit of structure you can get a lot out of it.
