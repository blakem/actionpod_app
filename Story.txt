15 Minute Calls: Accountability calls made easy

I'll admit it, I'm not the most organized person out there.  Emails go unanswered, projects get left idle for months, and my todo list 
sometimes seems frozen in time.  One of the best structures I've found for getting out of the rut is the accountability group.  It's a
simple concept:  Get a few motivated people together to support each other in getting their projects done.

Over the last six-months I've been participating in regular short accountability calls with three other people.  And for the most part 
it's been great!  It's helped me stay organized and focused on what's important to me.

However, accountability groups have two major drawbacks.  First, they're difficult to get started. Second, they seem to fade away after 
a very short amount of time.  Finding a dedicated group that's available and committed to making the calls is a challenge.  Then life
happens, schedules shift, emergencies crop up, and pretty soon the accountability group slips away, often without anyone even 
acknowledging that it's gone.

I was in that position a couple months ago, my accountability group was slowly drifting apart.  I thought about
what I could do to bring more people into it.  Over the course of a few weeks I came up with an idea.  Solve it all at once
for everyone.  Here was my plan:
    1. Build a system that can match people up with others who are available at the same time
    2. Have that system call each person and connect them with two others for their accountability group
    3. Let them run wild
