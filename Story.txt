15 Minute Calls: Accountability calls made easy

I'll admit it, I'm not the most organized person out there.  Emails go unanswered, projects get left idle for months, 
and my todo list sometimes seems frozen in time.  One of the best structures I've found for getting out of the rut is 
the accountability group.  It's a simple concept:  Get a few motivated people together to support each other in getting
their projects done.

Over the last six months I've been participating in regular short accountability calls with three other people.  And for 
the most part it's been great!  It's helped me stay organized and focused on what's important to me.

However, accountability groups have two major drawbacks.  First, they're difficult to get started. Second, they seem to 
fade away fairly quickly.  Finding a dedicated group that's available and committed to making the calls is a challenge.  
Then life happens, schedules shift, emergencies come up, and pretty soon the accountability group slips away, often without 
anyone even acknowledging that it's gone.

I was in that position a couple months ago, my accountability group was slowly drifting apart.  I thought about what I 
could do to bring more people into it.  Over the course of a few weeks I came up with an idea.  Solve it all at once for 
everyone!  If I built a system that could handle hundreds of accountability calls at different times, all anyone else would 
have to do was pick a time that worked for them and join that group.  Perfect!

That system is now built and is called 15 Minute Calls (www.15minutecalls.com).  Here's how it works:
    1. Become one of the beta members
    2. Enter in a few goals or a project that you're working on
    3. Pick a few times during the week you're available for a regular short accountability call.

That's it.  Once you're set up, the system will call you and connect you with two other members.  Your team will have 15 minutes to 
check-in and support each other around your goals.  The call ends promptly and automatically after 15 minutes.
