<h1>Welcome to our beta release!</h1>
<p><font size="+1">
  For the last six-months, I've had regular fifteen-minute accountability calls with two other 
  successful entrepreneurs. It's helped me stay focused, on point, and moving forward.
</font></p><p><font size="+1">
  15 Minute Calls brings this concept to a new level.  <strong>Pick three goals and a few times during the week that you're available.
  We'll call you when the time arrives, and connect you with two other members</strong>.   Your team will have 15 minutes to 
  check-in and support each other around your goals.
</font></p><p><font size="+1">
  During the beta-release, <strong>it's totally free</strong>, so sign up and take it for a test drive.  I 
  think you'll find it's a powerful way to get yourself moving.
