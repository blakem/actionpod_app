  Thanks for signing up for 15 Minute Calls, <%= @user.first_name %>.
</p>
<p>
  I'm sending you this email because you signed up for the service, but haven't tried it out just yet.
</p>
<p>
  You're just one step away from bringing more accountability into your life.  All you have to do is choose a time
  during the week when you're available for a quick group call with two other members.
</p>
<p>
  We currently have <%= @timeslots.count %> groups up and running.  Simply pick the one that works best for you. After
  clicking the 'Join this group' link, you can choose which days during the week you want your call.
</p>
<p>
    <% @timeslots.each do |ts| %>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<%= ts[:string] %> |
       <b><%= link_to 'Join this group', :only_path => false, :controller => :pages, :action => :join, :time => ts[:time] %></b>
       <br/>
    <% end %>
</p>
<p>
  Don't worry if your goals aren't crystal clear, or if you feel unprepared for the call.  Think of it as a way to
  connect with two other creative people for a simple chat about your various projects.  It's really that easy. ;-)
</p>
